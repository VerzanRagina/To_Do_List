In this project I have made the flutter application and displayed it on chrome itself.

About the app:
The to do list can add, remove and tick mark the to do items, i have added my own extra addition as colour as well as a marked to do to go to the bottom of the list to ensure unmarked ones show up.
To run this like I did using chrome, go to terminal and type in 'flutter run -d chrome' this will make sure vscode automatically opens and runs the application on chrome.
